Description: Providing classes, methods, and functions to deal with financial networks. 
    Users can easily store information about both physical and legal persons by using pre-made classes that are studied for integration with scraping packages such as 'rvest' and 'RSelenium'.
    Moreover, the package assists in creating various types of financial networks depending on the type of relation between its units depending on the relation under scrutiny (ownership, board interlocks, etc.), the desired tie type (valued or binary), and renders them in the most common formats (adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, edge list, 'igraph', 'network').
    There are also ad-hoc functions for the Fiedler value, global network efficiency, and cascade-failure analysis.
